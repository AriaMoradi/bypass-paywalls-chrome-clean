### New site requests:
Only large or major sites will be considered.
1. Visit an article on the site you want to bypass the paywall for and copy the article title.
2. Open up a new incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N) and paste the article title into Google.
3. Click on the same article from the Google search results page. If it loads without a paywall you can [submit a request](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome/issues/new) to add the site, otherwise my extension cannot bypass it either.

Usually premium articles cannot be bypassed as they are behind a hard paywall.

### Troubleshooting
* This extension works best alongside [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm).
* On some sites if you open an article and the paywall comes up try refreshing the page.
* For The Denver Post turn off uBlock.
