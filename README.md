More websites (specialized or local newspapers) are available in the [custom list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/master/sites_custom.json) of the extension (select those you want to use in options).

### Sites with limited number of free articles
The free article limit can normally be bypassed by removing cookies for the site.*

Install the [Cookie Remover](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-remover/kcgpggonjhmeaejebeoeomdlohicfhce) extension. Please rate it 5 stars if you find it useful.

When coming across a paywall click the cookie icon to remove the cookies then refresh the page.

_*May not always succeed_

### New site requests
Only large or major sites will be considered.
1. Visit an article on the site you want to bypass the paywall for and copy the article title.
2. Open up a new incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N) and paste the article title into Google.
3. Click on the same article from the Google search results page. Or you can:
1. Disable javascript on the website by clicking the botton right icon `</>` on the uBlock panel.
2. Refresh the page.

If it loads without a paywall you can [submit a request](https://github.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/issues/new) to add the site, otherwise my extension cannot bypass it either.

Usually premium articles cannot be bypassed as they are behind a hard paywall. Please see for [previous requests](https://github.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before asking for a new website to be added.

### Troubleshooting
* This extension works best alongside [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm).
* If a site doesn't work, try turning off uBlock and refreshing. Also try reinstalling the extension.
* Make sure the site is checked under Options (on macOS sometimes the sites are unselected).
* Make sure you're running the last version of Bypass Paywalls.
* If none of these work, you can submit an issue [here](https://github.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/issues).

### Changelog
* Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/releases).
